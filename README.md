# FuelManagement
We have developed a software solution consisting of two (02) modules and a hardware solution. The software includes the module for monitoring refueling operations and the software part of the tank gauging system, and the module for predicting fuel consumption. As for the hardware solution, it is a sensor to probe the fuel level.
